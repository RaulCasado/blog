This week has been one of those intense development weeks where code evolves, tools get fine-tuned, and the project becomes more robust. I decided to pause new feature development to focus on a critical aspect: **systematic refactoring and tool setup**. As the project grew, I started noticing several "code smells" that made the codebase harder to maintain. It was time to tackle this technical debt head-on with a multi-phase approach.

## üöÄ Executive Summary

We've completed **18 commits** focusing on three main areas:

- **Development tool setup** (Husky, Commitlint, Prettier)
- **Massive component refactoring** (reducing props, better architecture)
- **Functional improvements** (tag filtering, deletion confirmations)

## üõ†Ô∏è Identifying the Bad Smells and Strategy

The first step was to analyze the current state and spot issues similar to last week, but with a focus on tools and UX.

### 1. Disorganized Tools

The lack of automation in the development workflow led to inconsistencies in commits and formatting. Without Git hooks or validations, human errors were easy to make.

### 2. Components with Excessive Props

Building on last week's legacy, components like `IdeaItem` were still suffering from prop drilling, with over 10 props complicating reusability.

### 3. Lack of Validations and Feedback

Forms lacked a unified validation system, and deletions had no confirmations, which could lead to accidental data loss.

## üèóÔ∏è The Improvement Strategy

With the issues identified, I mapped out a plan to integrate tools and refactor.

### Phase 1: Automation with Development Tools

I implemented **Husky + Commitlint + Prettier** to standardize the process:

- **Husky**: Automatic Git hooks to run commands before commits.
- **Commitlint**: Validation of commit messages with standard format (e.g., `feat(component): description`).
- **Prettier**: Automatic code formatting.
- **Lint-staged**: Runs linting only on modified files.

This eliminated inconsistencies and improved code quality from the start.

### Phase 2: Architectural Refactoring

I reduced the complexity of components with excessive props:

````tsx
<IdeaItem 
  idea={idea}
  isExpanded={expandedIdea === idea.id}
  onToggleExpand={() => setExpandedIdea(expandedIdea === idea.id ? null : idea.id)}
  onEditStart={() => handleEditStart(idea)}
  onDelete={() => onDeleteIdea(idea.id)}
  // ... 6 more props
/>
````

````tsx
<IdeaItem idea={idea} />  // Just 1 prop, rest comes from context
````

I introduced **IdeasMainViewProvider** and a unified `useForm` hook to manage global state and forms, applying the single responsibility principle.

### Phase 3: Functional Improvements

- **Complete Tag System**: Created reusable `TagInput` and tag filtering for ideas.
- **UX/UI Improvements**: Added deletion confirmations and form validations for better user feedback.
- **Performance Optimization**: Used `useMemo` and `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

## üìä Week Metrics

- **18 commits** following conventional commits
- **10+ components refactored**
- **3 new features** (tags, confirmations, filters)
- **0 bugs introduced** (thanks to automated tests)
- **Improved code maintainability**

## üéØ Lessons Learned

### 1. Early Automation

Implementing tools like Husky from the start saves time and reduces human errors.

### 2. Context for Excessive Props

When a component exceeds 5 props, Context is the ideal solution to decouple and simplify.

### 3. Custom Hooks

A unified `useForm` hook reduces duplicate code and improves validation consistency.

## üöÄ Next Steps

With a solid foundation, next week we'll focus on:

1. **CSS/Tailwind**: Bringing the project to life visually
2. **Backend Integration**: Connecting to REST API
3. **Testing**: Adding unit and integration tests
4. **Performance**: Additional optimizations

This process has been a massive task, but the improvements in code quality are already paying off. It's a reminder that building great software isn't just about adding features, but also nurturing the foundations.

Any questions about these improvements? What aspect would you like me to dive deeper into?
